# "How It Works" Page Rewrite - Complete ✅

## Summary
Completely rewrote the page to accurately reflect that TrustYourHost is a **directory platform** connecting travelers to hosts' direct booking websites, NOT a booking/payment platform.

## ❌ OLD Content (Misleading)

### Problems:
- Said "2. Book" implying booking through TrustYourHost
- Mentioned "book securely" on the platform
- Claimed "24/7 support team" for bookings

- No mention of hosts keeping 100% revenue
- Implied payment processing

### Old Structure:
```
How it Works
Your journey to a perfect stay in 3 simple steps

1. Discover → Explore properties
2. Book → Choose dates and book securely ❌
