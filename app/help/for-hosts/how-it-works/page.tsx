      <h2>What is TrustYourHost?</h2>
      <p>
        TrustYourHost is a curated directory connecting travelers to vacation rental 
        hosts with direct booking websites. We're not another Airbnb or VRBO—we don't 
        process bookings, handle payments, or take commissions. Instead, we drive 
        qualified traffic directly to your booking website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of us as a spotlight for your property. We help travelers discover your 
        vacation rental, then send them straight to your website where they book and 
        pay using your existing system.
      </p>

      <h2>How the Process Works</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Submit Your Property</h3>
      <p>
        Getting started takes less than 10 minutes. You'll provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Property details:</strong> Name, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, max guests</li>
        <li><strong>Photos:</strong> High-quality images showcasing your property</li>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> What makes your property special</li>
        <li><strong>Amenities:</strong> WiFi, parking, pool, pet-friendly, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Your booking website URL:</strong> Where guests will book</li>
        <li><strong>Price range:</strong> Nightly rate range for search filtering</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>No credit card required to submit.</strong> Your 60-day free trial 
        starts only after we approve your property.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: We Verify Your Property (24-48 Hours)</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike platforms that auto-approve listings, we manually review every property. 
        Our verification process ensures quality and builds trust with travelers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Booking website check:</strong> We verify your website is functional and accepts bookings</li>
        <li><strong>Photo authenticity:</strong> We confirm photos match your property (no stock images)</li>
        <li><strong>Property details:</strong> We check that information is accurate and complete</li>
        <li><strong>Host identity:</strong> We verify your contact information</li>
        <li><strong>Location verification:</strong> We confirm your property exists at the listed address</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This vetting process protects both you and travelers. It keeps our directory 
        high-quality and ensures guests arrive at your property knowing exactly what 
        to expect.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3: Your Property Goes Live</h3>
      <p>
        Once approved, your property is immediately featured:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Main directory:</strong> Searchable by location, dates, and amenities</li>
        <li><strong>City pages:</strong> Featured on relevant city landing pages</li>
        <li><strong>Experience categories:</strong> Listed under relevant themes (beachfront, mountain, urban, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>FIFA 2026 section:</strong> Premium placement if near host city stadiums</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Your 60-day free trial begins the moment your property goes live. During this 
        time, you'll have full access to analytics, featured placement, and all directory 
        benefits—completely free.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4: Travelers Discover You</h3>
      <p>
        Here's what happens when travelers find your property:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Travelers browse TrustYourHost looking for their ideal stay</li>
        <li>They discover your property in our curated directory</li>
        <li>They view your property details, photos, and amenities</li>
        <li>They click <strong>"Visit Website"</strong> to book</li>
        <li>They're redirected to your direct booking website</li>
        <li>They complete their booking on your site using your system</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We track every click, so you can see exactly how many travelers we're sending 
        to your website. This data is available in your host dashboard 24/7.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 5: You Manage the Booking</h3>
      <p>
        Once a traveler lands on your booking website:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They book using your calendar and payment system</li>
        <li>You communicate with them directly (no platform middleman)</li>
        <li>You set your own pricing, policies, and house rules</li>
        <li>You keep 100% of the booking revenue</li>
        <li>You handle check-in, the stay, and check-out</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        TrustYourHost never gets involved in bookings, payments, or guest relationships. 
        We're simply the bridge that connects quality travelers to quality hosts.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Do (and Don't Do)</h2>

      <h3>✅ What TrustYourHost Does:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manually verify</strong> every property before listing</li>
        <li><strong>Feature your listing</strong> in our curated directory</li>
        <li><strong>Drive qualified traffic</strong> to your booking website</li>
        <li><strong>Provide analytics</strong> showing views and clicks</li>
        <li><strong>Offer FIFA 2026</strong> premium placement opportunities</li>
        <li><strong>Help travelers discover</strong> authentic direct-booking properties</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain quality standards</strong> across the directory</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>❌ What TrustYourHost Doesn't Do:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Process bookings</strong> (guests book through your website)</li>
        <li><strong>Handle payments</strong> (you use your own payment processor)</li>
        <li><strong>Take commissions</strong> (you keep 100% of every booking)</li>
        <li><strong>Manage guest relationships</strong> (you communicate directly)</li>
        <li><strong>Control your pricing</strong> (you set your own rates)</li>
        <li><strong>Enforce policies</strong> (you make your own house rules)</li>
        <li><strong>Intervene in disputes</strong> (you handle guest issues)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Independence, Protected</h2>
      <p>
        Here's what makes TrustYourHost different: <strong>you maintain complete control.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        You're not dependent on our platform. Your booking website is yours. Your guest 
        relationships are yours. Your pricing strategy is yours. If you decide TrustYourHost 
        isn't the right fit, you simply cancel your subscription—and your business continues 
        exactly as before.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're not trying to own your business. We're trying to help you grow it by 
        connecting you with travelers who value authentic, direct-booking experiences.
      </p>

      <h2>Pricing: Simple and Transparent</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First property:</strong> $49/month after 60-day free trial</li>
        <li><strong>Additional properties:</strong> $39/month each</li>
        <li><strong>No setup fees</strong></li>
        <li><strong>No booking commissions</strong></li>
        <li><strong>No percentage fees</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cancel anytime</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
        Example: A host with 3 properties pays $49 + $39 + $39 = $127/month total
      </p>

      <p>
        Compare that to a 15% commission on a $2,000 booking ($300 per booking). 
        With TrustYourHost, you'd need just one booking every three months to break 
        even—and you keep the other 99% of your bookings commission-free.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Is This For?</h2>
      <p>
        TrustYourHost is perfect for hosts who:
      </p>

        <li>Want to reduce dependency on Airbnb, VRBO, and other OTAs</li>
        <li>Are tired of paying 15% commissions</li>
        <li>Manage 1-10 properties independently</li>
        <li>Value direct guest relationships</li>
        <li>Want exposure for FIFA World Cup 2026</li>
        <li>Prefer transparency and control</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Host Dashboard</h2>
      <p>

      </ul>

      <h2>Getting Featured on FIFA 2026 Pages</h2>
      <p>
        If your property is located in one of the 11 FIFA World Cup 2026 host cities 
        (Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, 
        Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle), you'll automatically receive:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Featured placement on city-specific FIFA pages</li>
        <li>Prominent display in search results for FIFA dates</li>
        <li>Inclusion in "Near Stadium" filters</li>
        <li>Exposure to international World Cup travelers</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The FIFA World Cup is expected to bring millions of visitors to North America 
        between June and July 2026. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for hosts 
        in these cities.
